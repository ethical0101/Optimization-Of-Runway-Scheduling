## Abstract
Efficient runway scheduling is critical for reducing delays while maintaining safe separation between aircraft. This paper presents an Adaptive Graph Neural Optimization for Runway Scheduling (AERIS-OPT) system that encodes flight states as graph features, produces neural priority scores, and applies separation-aware refinement to generate feasible schedules. We evaluate AERIS-OPT on a real flight dataset and compare it with FCFS, genetic algorithm (GA), and MILP baselines. Our system additionally provides a comprehensive analytics dashboard for operational visibility. Results show that AERIS-OPT yields the best composite score across delay, throughput, and safety metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of neural ranking combined with explicit separation enforcement.

## I. Introduction
Airports operate under strict safety separation rules while facing increasing traffic demand. Runway scheduling must minimize delays, maintain throughput, and provide transparent decisions to air traffic controllers. Classical heuristics such as FCFS are reliable but often fail to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. Optimization-based approaches can produce better schedules but may be costly to compute on large, real-world datasets.

This work addresses these limitations by integrating a graph neural scoring model with a separation-aware refiner to produce feasible schedules at scale. We also provide a unified pipeline from data ingestion to visualization and best-method selection.

## II. Problem Statement and Gap
Given a set of aircraft events with ETAs, wake classes, and operational constraints, the task is to assign runway times and sequences such that separation constraints are met and delays are minimized. Key gaps include:
1. Limited multi-objective evaluation (delay and safety are not jointly optimized).
2. Poor scalability of exact optimization on real datasets.
3. Lack of explainable dashboards for operational review.

## III. Methodology
### A. Data Preparation
We use ADS-B state vectors (`states_2022-06-27-23.csv`) and select runway events near the inferred airport center. Features include ETA (seconds), velocity, altitude, and wake class (one-hot). A wake-class separation matrix encodes required separation times.

### B. AERIS-OPT Model
The AERIS-OPT model uses a GraphEncoder to aggregate neighborhood features from an adjacency matrix derived from the separation graph. A scoring head outputs priority scores used by a differentiable soft-rank mechanism to produce an ordering.

### C. Separation-Aware Refinement
A refiner assigns runway availability and enforces minimum separation constraints, producing feasible schedules. This guarantees operational safety while enabling neural ranking to improve performance.

### D. Baselines
We compare against:
- **FCFS**: Orders by ETA with separation enforcement.
- **GA**: Genetic algorithm for sequence optimization.
- **MILP**: Baseline deterministic optimizer (placeholder).
- **NIS-LNS**: Neural insertion and large neighborhood search (experimental).

### E. Metrics
We evaluate:
- Total delay and average delay.
- Makespan and throughput.
- Average and minimum safety slack.
- Composite score based on normalized weighted factors.

## IV. System Implementation
The system is implemented in Python with PyTorch (GPU-enabled) and Streamlit. Outputs are standardized JSON schedules and a dashboard with timelines, free intervals, conflict heatmaps, and best-method selection.

## V. Results
**Dataset:** 224 runway events from 29,367 records.

AERIS-OPT achieved the best composite score, indicating improved multi-objective performance even when delay values are close to FCFS.

## VI. Discussion
AERIS-OPT demonstrates competitive performance and better composite ranking by balancing delay and safety. The strong performance of FCFS in total delay highlights the challenge of outperforming simple heuristics without extensive model training. The systemâ€™s real contribution is in providing a neural prioritization framework integrated with robust safety enforcement and transparent analytics.

## VII. Conclusion
We presented AERIS-OPT, a graph neural scheduling framework that integrates neural scoring with separation-aware refinement and comprehensive visualization. Results on a real dataset show that AERIS-OPT achieves the best composite performance and provides actionable insights through the dashboard.

## VIII. Future Work
1. Train the model on larger datasets for stronger generalization.
2. Improve NIS-LNS using faster incremental cost evaluation.
3. Incorporate runway-specific capacities and weather constraints.
4. Enable real-time streaming and online re-optimization.
